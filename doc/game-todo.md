# TO DO

* Add eye toggle node for levels with hasEyeToggle: true (all levels except 1). counting area can be hidden via eye
  toggle

* the “check” button turns to an arrow to indicate “next problem”

* Add Kittens: they can be moved and organized, but not change color

* Add a keep going dialog after 10 stars.

**Example**:

* The user selects 6
  * 6 blue kittens appear on the screen in random locations
* The selected number button (6 in this case) changes color (matches the color of the addend but with a slightly
  different hue – hex code tbd after color contrast checking happens) to indicate it has been depressed, but the user
  can organize the kittens, change the number of them, or move them prior to pressing “Check”  
  ![][image171]

* The user chooses another number (8). At that moment:
  * Eight blue kittens are now in the counting area
  * The number “8” button has changed color (matching the missing addend) to indicate what has been chosen, but is still
    enabled if a different number is chosen prior to pressing “check.” If the user does press a different number, the
    “8” button will return to a choose-able color/look
* Kittens are always interactive, as is ten-frame button  
  ![][image173]

* In the image below, the user has pressed “Check” and the ten-frame button (in either order the result shown below will
  be the same)
* The follow visual changes occur:
  * a red “x” appears near the number in the number bond
  * the outline around the incorrect right addend is red and has a thicker stroke
  * the “Check” button greys out as the user decides what number to choose next
  * the “8” button changes to disabled to indicate 8 is no longer a choice
  * **Note**: since this is a decomposition challenge level, the ten-frame button organizes the kittens into rows of 5
    on the left and right (rather than a single ten frame formation in the center)

  ![][image174]

* Visual changes (see image below)
  * the outline around the addend turns black (\*\* should be thicker as well)
  * \*\* the correct number button at the bottom turns a color to indicate correctness. Below shows green, but this
    might be confusing since the “total” circle is green. Probably should match the missing addend color.
  * all other numbers at the bottom all grey out

### Level 5 & 6

* Ten frame (organize) button organizes into separate locations since this is a decomposition screen  
  ![][image184]

### Level 7 (11-20): missing addend or total, sum equation only, fact fluency

* See logic
  for [sum equations](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1flSZAAlRbpN9OdGkYBMQ6HYyCsp31ruLrAm52y-_m1w/edit?pli=1#heading=h.o9d55p201mw3)
* Ten frame (organize) button arranges into a single ten frame in the center of the field since this is a “combine” or
  sum skill
* Example of the left addend missing  
  ![][image186]


* Example of the right addend missing  
  ![][image187]


* Example of the total missing  
  ![][image188]


* Example of the ten frame button being pressed  
  ![][image189]

### Level 8 (0-20): missing both addends, fact fluency,

* See logic for [sum equations](#heading=h.o9d55p201mw3)
* **Example** of starting state when left addend is chosen to be missing (not the first challenge)  
  ![][image190]
  * The user choses 6, presses the Tick Numbers checkbox, and sees the following:
    * The jump arrow for the left addend is dotted
    * The distance of the 11 arrow never changes and is solid

    ![][image191]

  * The user presses “Check”  
    ![][image192]
  * The user chooses 5 and unchecks the tick numbers checkbox  
    ![][image193]
  * The user presses “check”
    * The dotted jump turns to solid and has a thicker stroke
    * The correct number turns green while the others turn grey (disabled)
